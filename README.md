# customer-segmentation-using-clustering-ML
In this project, the objective is to divide the customers into different distinctive groups for optimizing marketing startegy. The clustering is performed on bank customers' credit cards details dataset.
Customer segmentation is a vital task for businesses aiming to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. This project focuses on exploring and comparing different clustering algorithms for customer segmentation, including K-means, Agglomerative Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

The project begins by collecting relevant customer data, such as demographic information, purchase history, and behavioral patterns. This dataset is then preprocessed and prepared for clustering analysis. Various preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and dimensionality reduction, may be applied to enhance the clustering performance.

Next, the K-means algorithm is utilized to partition the customer data into distinct clusters based on similarity of features. The algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squared distances and assigns each customer to the nearest centroid. The resulting clusters are analyzed and interpreted to gain insights into customer groups and their characteristics.

Additionally, the project explores Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, which builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting clusters based on a chosen distance metric. This approach allows for both a global and local view of the data's clustering structure, providing flexibility in identifying various levels of segmentation.

DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, is also employed to identify clusters based on the density of data points. It is particularly useful for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise in the data. The algorithm defines core points, which have a sufficient number of neighboring points, and expands clusters around them.

Furthermore, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are applied to capture the underlying probability distribution of the customer data. GMM represents each cluster as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, allowing for more flexible cluster shapes and accommodating overlapping clusters.

The project evaluates the performance and effectiveness of these clustering algorithms by assessing metrics such as silhouette score, calinski harabasz score, davies bouldin score. Additionally, visualization techniques, such as scatter plots and dendrograms, are employed to aid in the interpretation of the segmentation results.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation using various clustering algorithms, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights into their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
